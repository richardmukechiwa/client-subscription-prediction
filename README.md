# üíº Bank Client Subscription Prediction

A machine learning project to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using banking campaign data. The model is built with XGBoost, optimized using Optuna, and explained using SHAP values. It is deployed using Docker and Render.

## Project Overview

This project is a machine learning classification model designed to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and campaign-related features. The data comes from a marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese bank, where customers were contacted via phone calls.

A term deposit is a financial product where a customer deposits a fixed amount of money into a bank account for a specified period and earns interest over that term. It offers:

A guaranteed interest rate

A fixed term duration

Low risk, but with limited early withdrawal options

Users interact with the model via a simple web interface built with Flask. Upon submitting client data (such as age, balance, day of month. month, and outcome of previous campaigns), the model returns a real-time prediction indicating the likelihood of a successful subscription.

### Dataset Source

Name: Bank Marketing Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Description: Contains data related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, including both categorical and numerical features.

### Tech Stack

- Python for backend logic and model development

- Pandas & scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling

- Flask for web application development

- HTML/CSS for frontend user interface

- Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and prototyping

- Joblib for saving the trained model and pipeline


## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost** with **Optuna** for hyperparameter tuning
- **SMOTE** for class balancing
- **SHAP** for model explainability
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Render** for deployment
- **Flask** for interactive UI

## üîç Key Results
